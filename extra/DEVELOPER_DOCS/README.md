# Developer Documentation

This directory includes additional documentation and explanations of spaCy's internals. It's mostly intended for the spaCy core development team and contributors interested in the more complex parts of the library. The documents generally focus on more abstract implementation details and how specific methods and algorithms work, and they assume knowledge of what's already available in the [usage documentation](https://spacy.io/usage) and [API reference](https://spacy.io/api).

If you're looking to contribute to spaCy, make sure to check out the documentation and [contributing guide](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
