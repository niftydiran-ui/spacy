# spaCy: Industrial-strength NLP

spaCy is a library for **advanced Natural Language Processing** in Python and Cython. It's built on the very latest research, and was designed from day one to be used in real products.

spaCy comes with [pretrained pipelines](https://spacy.io/models) and currently supports tokenization and training for **70+ languages**. It features state-of-the-art speed and **neural network models** for tagging, parsing, **named entity recognition**, **text classification** and more, multi-task learning with pretrained **transformers** like BERT, as well as a production-ready [**training system**](https://spacy.io/usage/training) and easy model packaging, deployment and workflow management.

 **Version 3.8 out now!** [Check out the release notes here.](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/releases)

## About This Fork

This is a forked repository of the official spaCy library, used for exploring NLP entity recognition patterns, custom pipeline development, and learning advanced spaCy features for production AI applications.
